To create a repository on GitHub and push this project, follow these steps:

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Enter 'MobileTestSetup' as the repository name
3. Choose whether to make it public or private
4. Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license as we already have these files
5. Click 'Create repository'
6. After creating the repository, run the following command in the terminal:
   git push -u origin master

This will push your project to the newly created GitHub repository.
